# Diabetes Prediction System  

The **Diabetes Prediction System** is a machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals. Developed as part of my **final year BE project** and during my internship at **MeriSKILL**, this project combines data-driven insights with a user-friendly web interface for impactful healthcare predictions.  

---

## Overview  

- This system leverages **logistic regression**, a reliable classification algorithm, achieving an accuracy score of approximately **81%**.  
- The web interface, built using **Django**, ensures an intuitive experience for users to input diagnostic details and view predictions.  
- The project showcases the integration of **machine learning** and **web technologies** to address real-world healthcare challenges.
